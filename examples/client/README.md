# Nomplate rich client

This example shows how to build and use Nomplate for a client application.

This app includes a very thin express server and webpack build.

To build and run the example:

```bash
webpack --config webpack-client.config.js && node app.js
```

Then loading `http://localhost:3000` in a new browser window.

You'll need express installed and available from npm, but this should be the case if you've run `npm install` from the main repo.
