# Nomplate & Express

This example shows how to easily use Nomplate to render views on the server using Express.

The application entry point is at ./app.js and can be executed by running:

```bash
node app.js
```

Then loading `http://localhost:3000` in a new browser window.

You'll need express installed and available from npm, but this should be the case if you've run `npm install` from the main repo.
