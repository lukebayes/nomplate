h1. Nomplate

Nomplate is a little NodeJs Template DSL that uses CoffeeScript to generate markup. It is pronounced like 'Gnome-plate', and was heavily inspired by "Erector":http://erector.rubyforge.org .

Feel free to check out the straight up "Class-based example":https://github.com/lukebayes/nomplate/blob/master/examples/class/main.coffee (very Erector-ish), and the "Express integration":https://github.com/lukebayes/nomplate/tree/master/examples/express .

This project is still experimental, but if you find it interesting, please feel free to let me know by watching it or checking in with me on Twitter (@lukebayes)

h2. Installation

  npm install nomplate
